First day of this journey! Taking it slow and starting from the very start.
Quite frustrated by the pace I'm taking, but I keep telling myself that I have to be comfortable with the slow pace and that I should not rush things since I have a history of inconsistency when it comes to learning.
Slow but steady is way better than rushing things and not sticking to the routine.
I must find time everyday to do this, so that I can become competent 4 months from now! Go self!
